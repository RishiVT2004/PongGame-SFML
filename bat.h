/*
A header file (typically ending in .h or .hpp) is used to:

1. Declare classes, functions, and variables that can be shared between multiple .cpp files.

2. Separate interface from implementation â€” you put declarations in the .h file and define their behavior in the .cpp file.

3. Help organize code and reduce repetition using #pragma once or #ifndef to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file.

*/
